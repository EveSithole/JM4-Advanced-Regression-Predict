# Price Prediction Of Apples Per Kilogram:
Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn and develop on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Regression is a collection of machine learning algorithms for predicting a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the values of one or more predictor variables (x).

The objective of this project is to construct a regression algorithm, capable of accurately predicting how much a kilogram of Golden Delicious Apples will cost given certain features. Different regression algorithms such as multiple linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines and random forests will be trained and evaluated on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to select the best performing algorithm.
